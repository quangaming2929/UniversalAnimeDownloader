What is Universal Anime Downloader?
-----------------------------------

Universal Anime Downloader (UAD) is an anime downloader & extractor tool. It
fetches any anime film of interest and displays it to the user. UAD is meant to
make searching and downloading anime films easier. In addition, the program's
built-in video player has a lot of unique features to enhance the user's
experience.

    the most boring READMEs ever."

Download

Downloads are available in the [_Releases_][releases] page.

In addition, please contact me to get the `uadcorelib.dll` library. It is the
core of UAD and UAD won't work without it.

<!--
    Dear Quan,

    Please be specific on how people can contact you. You can make a section
    (started with a level-2 header) for that.

    Be ready. People may curious about why you don't provide the
    `uadcorelib.dll` publicly.
